These budding drug lords bumped up against an immutable law of labor: when there are a lot of people willing and able to do a job, that job generally doesn’t pay well. This is one of four meaningful factors that determine a wage. The others are the specialized skills a job requires, the unpleasantness of a job, and the demand for services that the job fulfills.

Just because they’re crazy about themseif, they think you’re crazy about them, too, and that you’re just dying to do them a favor. It’s sort of funny, in a way.

Adorno begins his Three Studies on Hegel with a rebuttal of the traditional question about Hegel exemplified by the title of Benedetto Croce’s book What Is Living and What Is Dead in the Philosophy of Hegel? Such a question presupposes, on the part of the author, the adoption of an arrogant position as judge of the past; but when we are dealing with a truly great philosopher the real question to be raised concerns not what this philosopher may still tell us, what he may still mean to us, but rather the opposite, namely, what we are, what our contemporary situation might be, in his eyes, how our epoch would appear to his thought.

The only way to grasp the true novelty of the New is to analyze the world through the lenses of what was “eternal” in the Old. If communism really is an “eternal” Idea, then it works as a Hegelian “concrete universality”: it is eternal not in the sense of a series of abstract-universal features that may be applied everywhere, but in the sense that it has to be re-invented in each new historical situation.

Long ago, John Maynard Keynes rendered this self-referentiality nicely when he compared the stock market to a silly competition in which the participants have to pick several pretty girls from a hundred photographs, the winner being the one who chooses girls closest to the average opinion: “It is not a case of choosing those which, to the best of one’s judgment, are really the prettiest, nor even those which average opinion genuinely thinks the prettiest. We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligence to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be.”

Perhaps then the economic meltdown will also be used as a “shock,” creating the ideological conditions for further liberal therapy? The need for such shock-therapy arises from the (often neglected) utopian core of neoliberal economics. The way the market fundamentalists react to the destructive results of implementing their recipes is typical of utopian “totalitarians”: they blame all failure on the compromises of those who realized their schemes (there was still too much state intervention, etc.), and demand nothing less than an even more radical implementation of their doctrines.

Likewise, in the era of Really Existing Socialism, pro-socialist ideologists tried to save the idea of socialism by claiming that the failure of the “people’s democracies” was the failure of a non-authentic version of socialism, not of the idea as such, so that existing socialist regimes required radical reforms rather than overthrow and abolition. It is not without irony to note how ideologists who once mocked this critical defense of socialism as illusory, and insisted that one should lay the blame on the very idea itself, now widely resort to the same line of defense: for it is not capitalism as such which is bankrupt, only its distorted realization. . .

the economic class opposition (poor farmers and blue-collar workers versus lawyers, bankers, and large companies) is transposed or re-coded onto the opposition of honest, hard-working Christian Americans versus the decadent liberals who drink lattes and drive foreign cars, advocate abortion and homosexuality, and mock patriotic sacrifice and simple “provincial” ways of life, and so forth. The enemy is thus perceived as the “liberal” elite who, through federal state intervention—from school-busing to legislating that Darwinian theory and perverted sexual practises be taught in class—want to undermine the authentic American way. The conservatives’ main economic demand is therefore to get rid of the strong state which taxes the population to finance its regulatory interventions; their minimal economic program is thus: “fewer taxes, fewer regulations.” From the standard perspective of the enlightened and rational pursuit of self-interest, the inconsistency of this ideological stance is obvious: the populist conservatives are literally voting themselves into economic ruin.

While admitting that, in the past and in the present, the free market system has often been over-exploitative with catastrophic consequences, the claim is now made that one can discern the signs of a new orientation which is aware that the capitalist mobilization of a society’s productive capacity can also be made to serve ecological goals, the struggle against poverty, and other worthy ends.

Liberalism is, in its very notion, “parasitic,” relying as it does on a presupposed network of communal values that it undermines in the course of its own development. Fundamentalism is a reaction—a false, mystificatory reaction of course—against a real flaw inherent within liberalism, and this is why fundamentalism is, over and again, generated by liberalism.

the dominant ideology is mobilizing mechanisms of dissimulation and self-deception which include a will to ignorance: “a general pattern of behavior among threatened human societies is to become more blinkered, rather than more focused on the crisis, as they fail.” The same goes for the ongoing economic crisis: in late Spring 2009 it was successfully “renormalized”—the panic blew over, the situation was proclaimed as “getting better,” or at least the damage as having been controlled (the price paid for this “recovery” in the Third World countries was, of course, rarely mentioned)—thereby constituting an ominous warning that the true message of the crisis had been ignored, and that we could relax once again and continue our long march towards the apocalypse.

“universal humanity is visible at the edges”:19 rather than giving multiple, distinct cultures equal due, whereby people are recognized as part of humanity indirectly through the mediation of collective cultural identities, human universality emerges in the historical event at the point of rupture. It is in the discontinuities of history that people whose culture has been strained to the breaking point give expression to a humanity that goes beyond cultural limits. And it is in our emphatic identification with this raw, free, and vulnerable state, that we have a chance of understanding what they say. Common humanity exists in spite of culture and its differences. A person’s nonidentity with the collective allows for subterranean solidarities that have a chance of appealing to universal, moral sentiment, the source today of enthusiasm and hope.20

That is to say, the central problem we are facing today is how the predominance (or even hegemonic role) of “intellectual labor” within late capitalism affects Marx’s basic scheme of the separation of labor from its objective conditions, and of the revolution as the subjective re-appropriation of those conditions. In spheres like the World Wide Web, production, exchange and consumption are inextricably intertwined, potentially even identified: my product is immediately communicated to and consumed by another. Marx’s classic notion of commodity fetishism in which “relations between people” assume the form of “relations between things” has thus to be radically re-thought: in “immaterial labor,” “relations between people” are “not so much hidden beneath the veneer of objectivity, but are themselves the very material of our everyday exploitation,”42 so we cannot any longer talk about “reification” in the classic Lukácsian sense. Far from being invisible, social relationality in its very fluidity is directly the object of marketing and exchange: in “cultural capitalism,” one no longer sells (and buys) objects which “bring” cultural or emotional experiences, one directly sells (and buys) such experiences.

To put it another way: when, due to the crucial role of the “general intellect” (knowledge and social cooperation) in the creation of wealth, forms of wealth are increasingly “out of all proportion to the direct labour time spent on their production,” the result is not, as Marx seems to have expected, the self-dissolution of capitalism, but rather the gradual relative transformation of the profit generated by the exploitation of labor-power into rent appropriated by the privatization of this very “general intellect.”

The proletariat is thus divided into three, each part being played off against the others: intellectual laborers full of cultural prejudices against “redneck” workers; workers who display a populist hatred of intellectuals and outcasts; outcasts who are antagonistic to society as such. The old cry “Proletarians, unite!” is thus more pertinent than ever: in the new conditions of “postindustrial” capitalism, the unity of the three fractions of the working class is already their victory. This unity, however, will not be guaranteed by any figure of the “big Other” prescribing it as the “objective tendency” of the historical process itself—the situation is thoroughly open, divided between the two versions of Hegelianism.

‘Body Heat is technically not a nostalgia film,’ Jameson writes, since it takes place in a contemporary setting, in a little Florida village near Miami. On the other hand, this technical contemporaneity is most ambiguous indeed…Technically,…its objects (its cars, for instance) are 1980s products, but everything in the film conspires to blur that immediate contemporary reference and to make it possible to receive this too as nostalgia work – as a narrative set in some indefinable nostalgic past, an eternal 1930s, say, beyond history. It seems to me exceedingly symptomatic to find the very style of nostalgia films invading and colonizing even those movies today which have contemporary settings, as though, for some reason, we were unable today to focus our own present, as though we had become incapable of achieving aesthetic representations of our own current experience. But if that is so, then it is a terrible indictment of consumer capitalism itself – or, at the very least, an alarming and pathological symptom of a society that has become incapable of dealing with time and history.

one of the most important cultural experiences of the generations that grew up from the 1930s to the 1950s was the Saturday afternoon series of the Buck Rogers type – alien villains, true American heroes, heroines in distress, the death ray or the doomsday box, and the cliff-hanger at the end whose miraculous solution was to be witnessed next Saturday afternoon. Star Wars reinvents this experience in the form of a pastiche; there is no point to a parody of such series, since they are long extinct. Far from being a pointless satire of such dead forms, Star Wars satisfies a deep (might I even say repressed?) longing to experience them again: it is a complex object in which on some first level children and adolescents can take the adventures straight, while the adult public is able to gratify a deeper and more properly nostalgic desire to return to that older period and to live its strange old aesthetic artefacts through once again.

Or, as Berardi has argued, the intensity and precariousness of late capitalist work culture leaves people in a state where they are simultaneously exhausted and overstimulated. The combination of precarious work and digital communications leads to a besieging of attention. In this insomniac, inundated state, Berardi claims, culture becomes de-eroticised. The art of seduction takes too much time, and, according to Berardi, something like Viagra answers not to a biological but to a cultural deficit: desperately short of time, energy and attention, we demand quick fixes. Like another of Berardi’s examples, pornography, retro offers the quick and easy promise of a minimal variation on an already familiar satisfaction. The other explanation for the link between late capitalism and retrospection centres on production. Despite all its rhetoric of novelty and innovation, neoliberal capitalism has gradually but systematically deprived artists of the resources necessary to produce the new. In the UK, the postwar welfare state and higher education maintenance grants constituted an indirect source of funding for most of the experiments in popular culture between the 1960s and the 80s.

Producing the new depends upon certain kinds of withdrawal – from, for instance, sociality as much as from pre-existing cultural forms – but the currently dominant form of socially networked cyberspace, with its endless opportunities for micro-contact and its deluge of YouTube links, has made withdrawal more difficult than ever before. Or, as Simon Reynolds so pithily put it, in recent years, everyday life has sped up, but culture has slowed down.

But perhaps even more troubling, it is a Left that has become more attached to its impossibility than to its potential fruitfulness, a Left that is most at home dwelling not in hopefulness but in its own marginality and failure, a Left that is thus caught in a structure of melancholic attachment to a certain strain of its own dead past, whose spirit is ghostly, whose structure of desire is backward looking and punishing.’

the weird is that which does not belong. The weird brings to the familiar something which ordinarily lies beyond it, and which cannot be reconciled with the “homely” (even as its negation). The form that is perhaps most appropriate to the weird is montage — the conjoining of two or more things which do not belong together. Hence the predilection within surrealism for the weird, which understood the unconscious as a montage-machine, a generator of weird juxtapositions.

A sense of the eerie seldom clings to enclosed and inhabited domestic spaces; we find the eerie more readily in landscapes partially emptied of the human. What happened to produce these ruins, this disappearance? What kind of entity was involved? What kind of thing was it that emitted such an eerie cry? As we can see from these examples, the eerie is fundamentally tied up with questions of agency. What kind of agent is acting here? Is there an agent at all? These questions can be posed in a psychoanalytic register — if we are not who we think we are, what are we? — but they also apply to the forces governing capitalist society. Capital is at every level an eerie entity: conjured out of nothing, capital nevertheless exerts more influence than any allegedly substantial entity.

Americans have retreated to purely personal preoccupations. Having no hope of improving their lives in any of the ways that matter, people have convinced themselves that what matters is psychic self-improvement: getting in touch with their feelings, eating health food, taking lessons in ballet or belly-dancing, immersing themselves in the wisdom of the East, jogging, learning how to “relate,” overcoming the “fear of pleasure.” Harmless in themselves, these pursuits, elevated to a program and wrapped in the rhetoric of authenticity and awareness, signify a retreat from politics and a repudiation of the recent past.

In the heat of the struggle to win the West, the American pioneer gave full vent to his rapacity and murderous cruelty, but he always envisioned the result—not without misgivings, expressed in a nostalgic cult of lost innocence—as a peaceful, respectable, churchgoing community safe for his women and children. He imagined that his offspring, raised under the morally refining influence of feminine “culture,” would grow up to be sober, law-abiding, domesticated American citizens, and the thought of the advantages they would inherit justified his toil and excused, he thought, his frequent lapses into brutality, sadism, and rape.

The growth of bureaucracy creates an intricate network of personal relations, puts a premium on social skills, and makes the unbridled egotism of the American Adam untenable. Yet at the same time it erodes all forms of patriarchal authority and thus weakens the social superego, formerly represented by fathers, teachers, and preachers. The decline of institutionalized authority in an ostensibly permissive society does not, however, lead to a “decline of the superego” in individuals. It encourages instead the development of a harsh, punitive superego that derives most of its psychic energy, in the absence of authoritative social prohibitions, from the destructive, aggressive impulses within the id.

Plagued by anxiety, depression, vague discontents, a sense of inner emptiness, the “psychological man” of the twentieth century seeks neither individual self-aggrandizement nor spiritual transcendence but peace of mind, under conditions that increasingly militate against it. Therapists, not priests or popular preachers of self-help or models of success like the captains of industry, become his principal allies in the struggle for composure; he turns to them in the hope of achieving the modern equivalent of salvation, “mental health.” Therapy has established itself as the successor both to rugged individualism and to religion; but this does not mean that the “triumph of the therapeutic” has become a new religion in its own right. Therapy constitutes an antireligion, not always to be sure because it adhreres to rational explanation or scientific methods of healing, as its practitioners would have us believe, but because modern society “has no future” and therefore gives no thought to anything beyond its immediate needs. Even when therapists speak of the need for “meaning” and “love,” they define love and meaning simply as the fulfillment of the patient’s emotional requirements. It hardly occurs to them—nor is there any reason why it should, given the nature of the therapeutic enterprise—to encourage the subject to subordinate his needs and interests to those of others, to someone or some cause or tradition outside himself. “Love” as self-sacrifice or self-abasement, “meaning” as submission to a higher loyalty—these sublimations strike the therapeutic sensibility as intolerably oppressive, offensive to common sense and injurious to personal health and well-being.

These conventions, now condemned as constricting, artificial, and deadening to emotional spontaneity, formerly established civilized boundaries between people, set limits on the public display of feeling, and promoted cosmopolitanism and civility.

These conventions, now condemned as constricting, artificial, and deadening to emotional spontaneity, formerly established civilized boundaries between people, set limits on the public display of feeling, and promoted cosmopolitanism and civility. In eighteenth-century London or Paris, sociability did not depend on intimacy. “Strangers meeting in the parks or on the streets might without embarrassment speak to each other.” They shared a common fund of public signs which enabled people of unequal rank to conduct a civilized conversation and to cooperate in public projects without feeling called upon to expose their innermost secrets.

These patients, though often ingratiating, tend to cultivate a protective shallowness in emotional relations. They lack the capacity to mourn, because the intensity of their rage against lost love objects, in particular against their parents, prevents their reliving happy experiences or treasuring them in memory. Sexually promiscuous rather than repressed, they nevertheless find it difficult to “elaborate the sexual impulse” or to approach sex in the spirit of play. They avoid close involvements, which might release intense feelings of rage. Their personalities consist largely of defenses against this rage and against feelings of oral deprivation that originate in the pre-Oedipal stage of psychic development.

Often these patients suffer from hypochondria and complain of a sense of inner emptiness. At the same time they entertain fantasies of omnipotence and a strong belief in their right to exploit others and be gratified. Archaic, punitive, and sadistic elements predominate in the superegos of these patients, and they conform to social rules more out of fear of punishment than from a sense of guilt.

The narcissist comes to the attention of psychiatrists for some of the same reasons that he rises to positions of prominence not only in awareness movements and other cults but in business corporations, political organizations, and government bureaucracies. For all his inner suffering, the narcissist has many traits that make for success in bureaucratic institutions, which put a premium on the manipulation of interpersonal relations, discourage the formation of deep personal attachments, and at the same time provide the narcissist with the approval he needs in order to validate his self-esteem.

Narcissism appears realistically to represent the best way of coping with the tensions and anxieties of modern life, and the prevailing social conditions therefore tend to bring out narcissistic traits that are present, in varying degrees, in everyone. These conditions have also transformed the family, which in turn shapes the underlying structure of personality. A society that fears it has no future is not likely to give much attention to the needs of the next generation, and the ever-present sense of historical discontinuity—the blight of our society—falls with particularly devastating effect on the family.

The apparatus of mass promotion attacks ideologies based on the postponement of gratification; it allies itself with sexual “revolution”; it sides or seems to side the women against male oppression and with the young against the authority of their elders. The logic of demand creation requires that women smoke and drink in public, move about freely, and assert their right to happiness instead of living for others. The advertising industry thus encourages the pseudo-emancipation of women, flattering them with its insinuating reminder, “You’ve come a long way, baby,” and disguising the freedom to consume as genuine autonomy. Similarly it flatters and glorifies youth in the hope of elevating young people to the status of full-fledged consumers in their own right, each with a telephone, a television set, and a hi-fi in his own room. The “education” of the masses has altered the balance of forces within the family, weakening the authority of the husband in relation to the wife and parents in relation to their children. It emancipates women and children from patriarchal authority, however, only to subject them to the new paternalism of the advertising industry, the industrial corporation, and the state.*

In our time, the elimination of skills not only from manual work but from white-collar jobs as well has created conditions in which labor power takes the form of personality rather than strength or intelligence.

the picture of harmonious domestic life, on which the family attempts to model itself, derives not from spontaneous feeling but from external sources, and the effort to conform to it therefore implicates the family in a charade of togetherness or “pseudo-mutuality,” as one student of schizophrenia calls it. The mother in particular, on whom the work of childrearing devolves by default, attempts to become an ideal parent, compensating for her lack of spontaneous feeling for the child by smothering him with solicitude. Abstractly convinced that her child deserves the best of everything, she arranges each detail of his life with a punctilious zeal that undermines his initiative and destroys the capacity for self-help. She leaves the child with the feeling, according to Kohut, that he has “no mind of his own.” His idealistically inflated impressions of the mother persist unmodified by later experience, mingling in his unconscious thoughts with fantasies of infantile omnipotence. A case reported by Annie Reich shows in exaggerated form what the absence of the father does to the relations between mother and child. The patient, a bright young woman who had embarked on a successful career as a teacher, “wavered between her feelings of grandiosity and an awareness that she was not as grandiose as she wanted to be.” Secretly she believed she was a genius, who in her own words would “suddenly reveal herself and stand out as an obelisk.” The

Jules Henry found that high school teachers actually feared quiet and restraint in their classrooms, justifying their failure to enforce order on the grounds that imposition of silence interferes with spontaneous expression and creates unnecessary fears. “A quiet classroom may be an awfully fearful situation for someone,” said one teacher, whose classroom grew so noisy that the students themselves clamored for quiet. According to Henry, the classroom teaches children “their first lessons in how to live in the ‘friendly,’ ‘relaxed’ climates of the contemporary bureaucracies of business and government.”

Since everyone allegedly plays this game by the same rules, no one can begrudge him his success; but neither can the losers escape the heavy sense of their own failure. In a society without authority, the lower orders no longer experience oppression as guilt. Instead, they internalize a grandiose idea of the opportunities open to all, together with an inflated opinion of their own capacities. If the lowly man resents those more highly placed, it is only because he suspects them of grandly violating the regulations of the game, as he would like to do himself if he dared. It never occurs to him to insist on a new set of rules.

Sometimes one parent acquiesces in the neurosis of the other (as in the family configuration that produces so many schizophrenic patients) for fear of disturbing the precarious peace of the household.

Sex valued purely for its own sake loses all reference to the future and brings no hope of permanent relationships. Sexual liaisons, including marriage, can be terminated at pleasure. This means, as Willard Waller demonstrated a long time ago, that lovers forfeit the right to be jealous or to insist on fidelity as a condition of erotic union.

In theory, it should be possible for feminists to advance beyond the present stage of sexual recrimination by regarding men simply as a class enemy, involuntarily caught up in the defense of masculine privilege and therefore exempt from personal blame. The symbiotic interdependence of men and women, however, makes it hard to attain such intellectual detachment in everyday life. The “class enemy” presents himself in ordinary existence as a lover, husband, or father, on whom women proceed to make demands that men usually fail to meet.

The superego can no longer ally itself, in its battle against impulse, with outside authorities. It has to rely almost entirely on its own resources, and these too have diminished in their effectiveness. Not only have the social agents of repression lost much of their force, but their internal representations in the superego have suffered a similar decline. The ego ideal, which cooperates in the work of repression by making socially acceptable behavior itself an object of libidinal cathexis, has become increasingly pallid and ineffective in the absence of compelling moral models outside the self.

As even the rich lose the sense of place and historical continuity, the subjective feeling of “entitlement,” which takes inherited advantages for granted, gives way to what clinicians call “narcissistic entitlement”—grandiose illusions, inner emptiness. The advantages the rich confer on their children dwindle down to money alone. As the new elite discards the outlook of the old bourgeoisie, it identifies itself not with the work ethic and the responsibilities of wealth but with an ethic of leisure, hedonism, and self-fulfillment.

American progressivism, which has successfully countered agrarian radicalism, the labor movement, and the feminist movement by enacting selective parts of their program, has now lost almost all trace of its origin in nineteenth-century liberalism. It has rejected the liberal conception of man, which assumed the primacy of rational self-interest, and has installed in its place a therapeutic conception which acknowledges irrational drives and seeks to divert them into socially constructive channels. It has rejected the stereotype of economic man and has attempted to bring the “whole man” under social control. Instead of regulating the conditions of work alone, it now regulates private life as well, organizing leisure time on scientific principles of social and personal hygiene. It has exposed the innermost secrets of the psyche to medical scrutiny and has thus encouraged habits of anxious self-scrutiny, superficially reminiscent of religious introspection but rooted in anxiety rather than a guilty conscience—in a narcissistic rather than a compulsive or hysterical type of personality.

Walking in nature, we see, identify, name, recognize. This recognition is our apotropaion, that is, our warding off of fear. Recognition is ritual cognition, a repetition-compulsion. We say that nature is beautiful. But this aesthetic judgment, which not all peoples have shared, is another defense formation, woefully inadequate for encompassing nature’s totality. What is pretty in nature is confined to the thin skin of the globe upon which we huddle. Scratch that skin, and nature’s daemonic ugliness will erupt.

Today’s nihilism – the reign of cynical opportunism accompanied by permanent anxiety – legitimizes itself as the liberation from the old constraints: we are free to constantly re-invent our sexual identities, to change not only our job or our professional trajectory but even our innermost subjective features like our sexual orientation. However, the scope of these freedoms is strictly prescribed by the coordinates of the existing system, and also by the way consumerist freedom effectively functions: the possibility to choose and consume imperceptibly turns into a superego obligation to choose. The nihilist dimension of this space of freedoms can only function in a permanently accelerated way – the moment it slows down, we become aware of the meaninglessness of the entire movement. This New World Disorder, this gradually emerging world-less civilization, exemplarily affects the young, who oscillate between the intensity of fully burning out (sexual enjoyment, drugs, alcohol, even violence), and the endeavour to succeed (study, make a career, earn money … within the existing capitalist order). Permanent transgression thus becomes the norm – consider the deadlock of sexuality or art today: is there anything more dull, opportunistic or sterile than to succumb to the superego injunction to incessantly invent new artistic transgressions and provocations (the performance artist masturbating on stage or masochistically cutting himself, the sculptor displaying decaying animal corpses or human excrement), or to the parallel injunction to engage in more and more ‘daring’ forms of sexuality?

There are a multitude of ways in which this un-freedom appears in the guise of its opposite: when we are deprived of universal healthcare, we are told that we are given a new freedom of choice (to choose our healthcare provider); when we can no longer rely on long-term employment and are compelled to search for a new, precarious position every couple of years, we are told that we are given the opportunity to reinvent ourselves and discover novel, unexpected creative potentials that lurk in our personality; when we have to pay for the education of our children, we are told that we become ‘entrepreneurs of the self’, acting like a capitalist who chooses freely how he will invest the resources he possesses (or has borrowed) in education, health, travel … Constantly bombarded by so-called ‘free choices’, forced to make decisions for which we are mostly not even properly qualified (or about which we possess inadequate information), increasingly we experience our freedom as what it effectively is: a burden that deprives us of the true choice of change.

‘Until and unless you discover that money is the root of all good, you ask for your own destruction. When money ceases to become the means by which men deal with one another, then men become the tools of other men. Blood, whips and guns or dollars. Take your choice – there is no other.’11 Did Marx not say something similar in his well-known formula of how, in the universe of commodities, ‘relations between people assume the guise of relations among things’? In the market economy, relations between people can appear as ones of mutually recognized freedom and equality; domination is no longer directly enacted and visible as such. Socialism as it really existed in the twentieth century proved that overcoming market-alienation abolishes ‘alienated’ freedom, and with it freedom tout court, bringing us back to ‘non-alienated’ relations of direct domination.

This latter sense of “reaction” is a recurring, subterranean tendency that can arise from the Left as well as the Right. It is most likely to emerge from the Right, but in periods when “the Left” becomes especially decadent, the responsibility to transgress “the Left” will occasionally fall to an otherwise proper leftist.

The juridical distinction between contract and institution is well known: the contract presupposes in principle the free consent of the contracting parties and determines between them a system of reciprocal rights and duties; it cannot affect a third party and is valid for a limited period. Institutions, by contrast, determine a long-term state of affairs which is both involuntary and inalienable; it establishes a power or an authority which takes effect against a third party. But even more significant is the difference between the contract and the institution with respect to what is known as a law: the contract actually generates a law, even if this law oversteps and contravenes the conditions which made it possible; the institution is of a very different order in that it tends to render laws unnecessary, to replace the system of rights and duties by a dynamic model of action, authority and power. Saint-Just accordingly demanded that there should be many institutions and few laws, and proclaimed that the Republic could not be a republic so long as laws had the supremacy over institutions… In short, the specific impulse underlying the contract is toward the creation of a law, even if in the end the law should take over and impose its authority upon the contract itself; whereas the corresponding impulse at work in the case of the institution is toward the degradation of all laws and the establishment of a superior power that sets itself above them (pp. 77).

we should abandon the attempt to expand the definition of value so that all kinds of labour are recognized as a source of value – recall the great feminist demand of the 1970s to recognize housework (from cooking and maintaining the household to caring for children) as being productive of value, or the demands of some contemporary eco-capitalists to integrate the ‘free gifts of nature’ into value production (by way of trying to determine the costs of water, air, forests and all other commons). All these proposals are ‘nothing more than a sophisticated green-washing and commodification of a space from which a fierce attack upon the hegemony of the capitalist mode of production and its (and our) alienated relation to nature can be mounted’:14 in their attempt to be ‘just’ and to eliminate or at least constrain exploitation, such actions merely enforce an even stronger, all-encompassing commodification. Although they try to be ‘just’ at the level of content (what counts as value), they fail to problematize the very form of commodification: value should be treated in dialectical tension with non-value, i.e. to assert and expand spheres not caught in the production of market value, like housework or ‘free’ cultural and scientific work, in their crucial role. Value production can only thrive if it incorporates its inherent negation, the creative work that generates no market value; it is by definition parasitic on it. So instead of commodifying exceptions and including them in the process of valorization, one should leave them outside and destroy the frame that makes their status inferior. The problem with fictitious capital is not that it is outside valorization but that it remains parasitic on the fiction of a valorization to come. A further challenge to the market economy comes from the spreading virtualization of money, which compels us to thoroughly reformulate the standard Marxist concepts of ‘reification’ and ‘commodity fetishism’, insofar as this topic still relies on the notion of a fetish as a solid object whose stable presence obfuscates its social mediation. Paradoxically, fetishism reaches its acme precisely when the fetish itself is ‘dematerialized’, turned into a fluid, ‘immaterial’ virtual entity; money fetishism will culminate in its passage into electronic form, when the last traces of its materiality disappear. Electronic money is the third form, after ‘real’ money, which directly embodies its value (gold, silver), and paper money, which, although a ‘mere sign’ with no intrinsic value, still clings to its material existence. And it is only at this stage, when money becomes a purely virtual point of reference, that it finally assumes the form of an indestructible spectral presence: I owe you $1,000, and no matter how many material notes I burn, I still owe you $1,000, the debt is inscribed somewhere in the virtual digital space. It is only with this thorough ‘dematerialization’ that Marx’s famous old thesis from The Communist Manifesto – according to which, in capitalism, ‘all that is solid melts into air’ – acquires a much more literal meaning than the one he had in mind, when not only our material social reality is dominated by the speculative movement of capital, but this reality itself is progressively ‘spectralized’ (the ‘Protean Self’ instead of the old self-identical subject, the elusive fluidity of its experiences instead of the stability of the owned objects) – in short, when the usual relationship between material objects and immaterial ideas is turned upside down (objects are progressively dissolved in fluid experiences, while the only stable things are virtual symbolic obligations). It is only at this point that what Derrida called the spectral aspect of capitalism is fully actualized. However, as we have already seen, such spectralization of the fetish contains the seeds of its opposite, of its self-negation: the unexpected return of direct relations of personal domination. Capitalism legitimizes itself as the economic system that implies and furthers personal freedoms (as a condition of market exchange); but its own dynamics have brought about a renaissance of slavery.

These systems can accommodate themselves to great disturbances, integrate and find new balance and stability – up to a certain threshold (a ‘tipping point’), above which a small disturbance can cause a total catastrophe and lead to the establishment of a completely different order.

For centuries, humanity did not have to worry about the impact on the environment of its productive activity – nature was able to accommodate itself to deforestation, to the use of coal and oil, and so on. However, we cannot be sure if, today, we are not approaching a tipping point – we really cannot be sure, since such points are only clearly perceived once it is already too late, in retrospect. Either we take the threat of environmental catastrophe seriously and decide today to do things that, if the catastrophe doesn’t occur, will appear ridiculous, or we do nothing and lose everything if it does happen. The worst scenario is to choose a middle ground, to take a limited number of measures – in this case, we will fail whatever occurs (that is to say, the problem is that there is no middle ground: either the environmental catastrophe will occur or it won’t).

In the late 1920s, none other than Stalin for a while financially supported the ‘human ape’ project proposed by the biologist Ilya Ivanov (a follower of Alexander Bogdanov, the target of Lenin’s critique in Materialism and Empirio-Criticism): the idea was that by coupling humans and orangutans one could create a perfect worker and soldier impervious to pain, tiredness and bad food. In his innate racism and sexism, Ivanov, of course, tried to couple male humans and female apes; plus the humans he used were black males from the Congo, since they were supposed to be genetically closer to apes – the Soviet state financed an expensive expedition there.

After the February Revolution, Lenin immediately saw a unique chance to take power. His insight resulted from his analysis of a very specific constellation – it was not an expression of some abstract ‘decisionism’. On the other hand, there was much more ‘utopianism’ in Lenin’s efforts to fill the free space outside the capitalist system with new content. The paradox is that he was a pragmatist in terms of how to grab power, and a utopian in terms of what to do with it.

This was the truth of Soviet Leninism. Lenin served as the ultimate reference: a quote of his legitimized any political, economic or cultural measure, but in a totally pragmatic and arbitrary way – in exactly the same way, incidentally, that the Catholic Church referred to the Bible. (One should also consider to what extent Lenin himself used Marx’s texts in a similar way.) In other words, the reference to Lenin posed no boundaries whatsoever: any political measure was acceptable if legitimized by a quote of his. Marxism thus becomes a ‘world-view’ allowing us access to objective reality and its laws, and this process brings a new false sense of security: our acts are ‘ontologically’ covered, part of ‘objective reality’ regulated by laws known to us Communists.

Revolutionaries have to wait patiently for the (usually very brief) period of time when the system openly malfunctions or collapses, then seize the window of opportunity, grasp the power that at that moment lies on the street, as it were, and is up for grabs, and then tighten their hold on that power, building repressive apparatuses and so on. Then, once the moment of confusion is over, and the majority have sobered up and are disappointed by the new regime, it is too late to get rid of it and it is firmly entrenched.

Recall the traditional liberal notion of representative power: citizens transfer part of their power to the state, but on precise terms (this power is constrained by law, limited to very precise conditions in the way it is exercised, since the people remain the ultimate source of sovereignty and can withdraw power if they decide so). In short, the state with its power is the minor partner in a contract that the major partner (the people) can at any point annul or change, basically in the same way each of us can change the supermarket where we do our shopping. However, the moment we take a closer look at an edifice of state power, we can easily detect an implicit but unmistakable message: ‘Forget about our limitations – ultimately, we can do whatever we want with you!’ This excess is not an adjunct polluting the purity of power, but a necessary constituent – without it, without the threat of arbitrary omnipotence, state power is not a true power, it loses its authority.

There is thus in ‘free elections’ always a minimal aspect of politeness: those in power politely pretend that they do not really hold power, and ask us to freely decide if we want to restore them to power – in a way which mirrors the logic of a gesture meant to be refused.

in recent years, Marine Le Pen has gradually been de-diabolized, perceived as part of the ‘normal’ (acceptable) political space, and the task is to re-diabolize her, to show the political public that she remains the same old anti-Semitic fascist, and as such is not to be tolerated by any serious democrat. Such a gesture of re-diabolization is clearly not enough: instead of just focusing on the diabolic fetish, one should immediately ask the question of how such a ‘devil’ could have emerged in our society (in Le Pen’s case, she is a reaction to the policy whose embodiment is Macron).

Le Pen had been elected President in 2017, it could have triggered strong anti-fascist mobilization, rendering her re-election unthinkable, plus it could have given a strong push to the Leftist alternative. So the two disasters (Le Pen President now or the threat of Le Pen as President in five years) are not the same: the disaster after five years of Macron’s reign, if it turns out to be a failure, will be much more serious than the one which did not happen in 2017.

Historically, it was the task of the Left to ask such questions, so no wonder that, with the enemy diabolized, the radical Left conveniently disappears from the picture – recall how, in the 2017 elections in France, every Leftist scepticism about Macron was immediately denounced as support for Le Pen. So we can safely venture the hypothesis that this elimination of the Left was the true aim of the operation, and that the demonized enemy was a convenient prop.

And in the same way that the US Democratic establishment diabolizes Trump to get rid of Sanders, who poses a threat, the French establishment diabolized Le Pen to head off potential Leftist radicalization.

yes, Macron is pro-European – but what kind of Europe does he personify? The very Europe whose failure feeds Le Pen populism, the anonymous Europe in the service of neo-liberalism! This is the crux of the affair: yes, Le Pen is a threat, but if we throw all our support behind Macron, do we not get caught up in a kind of circle and fight the effect by way of supporting its cause? This brings to mind a chocolate laxative available in the US. It is publicized with the paradoxical injunction: ‘Do you have constipation? Eat more of this chocolate!’ – in other words, eat the very thing that causes constipation in order to be cured of it. In this sense, Macron is the chocolate-laxative candidate, offering us as a cure the very thing that caused the illness.

The key issue for the radical centre today is this: which of the two main parties, conservatives or liberals, will succeed in presenting itself as embodying the post-ideological non-politics as against the other party, which is dismissed as being ‘still caught up in old ideological spectres’? In the early 1990s, conservatives were better at it; later it was liberal Leftists who seemed to be gaining the upper hand, and Macron is the latest figure to represent a pure radical centre.

But the assuagement brought by Macron’s triumphant victory is no less dangerous, since his victory did not really awaken us – its effect is quite the opposite: sighs of relief everywhere, the nightmare is over, thank God the danger was kept at bay, Europe and our democracy are saved, so now we can go back to our liberal-capitalist sleep again.

let’s begin to talk seriously, that is, to think! And by this I mean we should also leave behind the radical Leftist self-complacency of endlessly repeating how the choices we are offered in the political space are false, and how only a renewed radical Left can save us – yes, in a way, but why, then, does this Left not emerge? What vision has the Left to offer that would be strong enough to mobilize people?

While Macron’s stance is commendable, it is crucial to supplement it with a self-critical turn. The demonized image of a fascist threat clearly serves as a new political fetish, in the simple Freudian sense of a fascinating image whose function is to obfuscate the true antagonism. Fascism itself is inherently fetishist, it needs a figure like that of a Jew, condemned as the external cause of our troubles – such a figure enables us to obfuscate the immanent antagonisms that cut across our society. My claim is that exactly the same holds for the notion of ‘fascist’ in today’s liberal imagination: it enables us to obfuscate immanent deadlocks which lie at the root of our crisis.

When the black conservative Ben Carson was competing to become Republican presidential candidate, he presented his life story as the progress from a juvenile delinquent to a moral Christian. However, when journalists probed into his past, they were surprised to discover that he never was a delinquent: he had all the time been a modest, well-behaved boy. But now comes the true surprise: in response to this discovery, Carson’s propagandists stressed that Carson effectively was a delinquent in his youth – why this weird insistence? Wouldn’t it have been better for Carson to come across in the eyes of his supporters (mostly white Christian conservatives) as a good boy from the beginning? No: his delinquent past perfectly fitted his image, that of the usual black boy, caught up in crime and other vices, who found strength in hard work, discipline and Christianity. This is what his supporters wanted to see: not simply a good black boy (as such he would have to be recognized as one of us, fully equal to us), but somebody who first fully enjoyed being black in its transgressive aspects (the sins of ‘lower’ races always fascinate white conservatives and are clearly an object of ambiguous envy), and then found strength to castigate his black wildness and become a moral Christian like them. Recall that Carson also claimed that slavery, deplorable as it was, helped blacks to discover and accept Christianity: the role of Christianity in this story was to civilize the savage blacks by way of integrating them into white culture.

There is a delicious old Soviet joke about Radio Erevan (the Armenian radio station that was the traditional butt of Soviet jokes). A listener asks: ‘Is it true that Rabinovitch won a new car in the lottery?’ The radio answers: ‘In principle yes, it’s true, only it wasn’t a new car but an old bicycle, and he didn’t win it, it was stolen from him.’ The same goes for the French presidential elections of 2017: is it true that, in a great display of anti-fascist unity, the people of France elected an outsider and defeated a threat to Europe? In principle yes, only the victorious Macron represents a Europe out of touch with ordinary people, i.e. the very politics which gave such strength to Le Pen, and he is not an outsider but the establishment in its purest form.

(So much for the anti-Keynesian economic ideology that seems to predominate today!) This influx of money, which is effectively like the tithe paid to Rome in Antiquity (or the gifts sacrificed to Minotaur by ancient Greeks), relies on a complex economic mechanism: the US is ‘trusted’ as the safe and stable centre, so that all others, from the oil-producing Arab countries to Western Europe and Japan, and now even China, invest their surplus profits in the US. Since this trust is primarily ideological and military, not economic, the problem for the US is how to justify its imperial role – it needs a permanent state of war, so it has had to invent the ‘war on terror’, offering itself as the universal protector of all other ‘normal’ (not ‘rogue’) states.
